# Software Development with C++

This repository documents my progress through *“Software Development with C++” by Nick*, covering a wide range of topics essential for professional software engineering, including:

- **Compiler concepts** — optimization levels, compilation phases  
- **C++ fundamentals** — header files, header guards, inline variables  
- **Linking & libraries** — static vs. dynamic linking, shared libraries  
- **Debugging techniques** — Valgrind, AddressSanitizer, GDB, watchpoints, TUI, and record/replay debugging  
- **Build systems** — GNU Make (makefiles, phony targets, recursive make) and CMake (libraries, recursive builds)  
- **Code formatting and tooling** — clang-format and related practices  

---

### 📌 In addition to course-aligned implementations, the repository includes:
- **Self-practice experiments** and exploratory code  
- **Notes on debugging and compiler behaviors**  
- **Build system exercises** with make and CMake  

---

### 🎯 Objective
The objective is to develop a **deep, hands-on understanding** of how C++ software is compiled, linked, debugged, and optimized — a foundation for **advanced systems programming** and **professional-grade software development**.
